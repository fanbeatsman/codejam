face recognition by pixels

Usage: python compare.py [directory of pictures to match] [path to 1 picture you want to try matching]
eg: python compare.py allimages 6_9_.gif 

*note i did it on purpose to take out the exact 6_9_.gif from the matching folder so that the program does not trivially match 6_9_.gif to itself


Example database of pictures provided in directory "allimages"

virtualenv:

from PIL (maybe deprecated and replaced by pillow) import Image
